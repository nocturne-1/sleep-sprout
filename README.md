About : D <br>

When we asked our fellow Parthenon members if they got enough sleep at night, none of them raised their hands. In fact, 70-80% of highschoolers are chronically sleep deprived (a conditional that is severely detrimental to mental, emotional, and physical health)! Sleep -sprout guilts, cajoles, and shames you into sleep by representing your health via trusty plant companion Mr. Sprout (or you can choose whatever name). This plant will do well if users get appropriate amount of sleep, and wither away if they do not. The Sleep-sprout webapp is also paired with its wearable armband which detects how long a user sleeps + their sleep health. Don't let your plant whither away and get sleep!<br> **Plant >>> Math test next morning ** <br>

Inputs we took to monitor sleep:<br>
* temperature, movement, sound sensor (snoring)
